## Testing DocBox

DocBox has a suite of Testbox specs validating that it works as expected. New features and bug fix PRs should \(ideally\) contain accompanying tests. Here's how to do that via CommandBox:

1. After cloning the repo, run `box install` to install development dependencies
2. Run `box start` to boot a test server
3. Run `box testbox run` to run the suite of DocBox tests.
4. Edit test specs in `tests/specs` as necessary, and run `box testbox run` again to validate tests pass.
