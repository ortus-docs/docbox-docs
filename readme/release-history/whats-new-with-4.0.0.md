# What's New With 4.0.0

### BREAKING

* Dropped support for Adobe 2016. Adobe doesn't support ACF 16 anymore, so neither do we.

### NEW

* Added support for Adobe 2021
* Added support for `@myCustomTag` custom docblock tags on methods. (Already supported on components and properties, but missing on methods).
* Added GitHub Actions CI for automated testing, format checking, releases and more

### FIX

* Fixes support for Adobe 2018. (Mainly in the CommandBox strategy.)
