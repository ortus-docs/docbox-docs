# What's New With 4.1.0

### Added

* Adobe 2023 Testing and Support
* New Github Actions
* New supporting files
* New `build/Docs.cfc` task for building the documentation using itself, before we where getting away with it because there was a previous DocBox version. Now we need to build the docs with the current version of DocBox.

### Fixed

* Build Versions and changelog
* Removal of `box.zip` in root from old scripts
